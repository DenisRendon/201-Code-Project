          <p class="container-text" id="Containerid">Hello, my name is Denis. I was born in Texas and raised on a small ranch in south Texas. I joined the military in 2010 and was a blackhawk helciopter
            crewchief and flight instructor. After I exited in 2016 I became a Depart of the Army Civilian facility flight instructor at Fort Hood Aviation Support facility training reserve units.
            While I was in that position I was offered a contracting position with MAG Aerospace to work in Afghanistan training the Afghan airforce and then the Special Mission Wing(SMW) units on the UH60 airframe and the Mi17 v1/v5 airframe.
            I worked 3 years with them back and forth overseas. After that I joined Firefly Aerpsoaces intergration team working on the Alpha rocket. 
            I stayed for a short amount of time because I felt like I needed a change, a new career and location. I want to better myself and create more time with my family. 
            I am really excited about the remote factor of coding and am looking to get on with a company I believe in along with their product.
             I enjoy riding motorcycles and dirtbikes, going hiking and camping. Hunting and fishing but most of all being outdoors with my 3yr daugther and spending time with her and my wife. </p>
